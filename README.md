<h1>Enhanced Conway's Game of Life </h1>

I have been interested in Cellular Automata ever since I stumbled on Conway's game some time ago. I decided the best way to begin exploring is to start with the original. I have some goals in mind in regards to developing my skills as a programmer and so I am also using this as an opportunity to learn the C language, 2d graphics with sdl and android app development. 

<h3>Development goals:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>âˆš Implement a standard CLI version of the game</li>
  <li>Incorporate 2D graphics using SDL</li>
  <li>Expand game with customizeable rules, discrete/continuous modes and infinite or torus universe models</li>
</ol>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

SDL2
