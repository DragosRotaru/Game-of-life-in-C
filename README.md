<h1>Enhanced Conway's Game of Life </h1>

I have been interested in Cellular Automata ever since I stumbled on Conway's game some time ago. I decided the best way to begin exploring is to start with the original. I have some goals in mind in regards to developing my skills as a programmer and so I am also using this as an opportunity to learn the C language, 2d graphics with sdl and android app development. 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

SDL2

<h2>Development goals:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>âˆš Learn the C language by implementing a standard CLI version of the game</li>
  <li>Learn SDL and basic graphics</li>
  <li>expand the game with customizeable discrete rules and continuous mode</li>
  <li>port to android</li>
</ol>
