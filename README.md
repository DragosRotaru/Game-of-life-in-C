<h1>Update </h1>

Stopped work on this after I implemented the standard version in the CLI, before I Implemented SDL. Realized learning SDL and using C for this is a waste of time when I can learn a more useful rendering library like three.js. Left here for "historical reference".

<h1>Enhanced Conway's Game of Life </h1>

I have been interested in Cellular Automata ever since I stumbled on Conway's game some time ago. I decided the best way to begin exploring is to start with the original.

<h3>Development goals:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>âˆš Implement a standard CLI version of the game</li>
  <li>Incorporate 2D graphics using SDL</li>
  <li>Expand game with customizeable rules, discrete/continuous modes and infinite or torus universe models</li>
</ol>
